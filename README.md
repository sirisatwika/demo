# Requirements
## Introduction
* These days calculations have become most important to solve any problem in an effective manner and in a easy way without any mistakes.
* The Calculator application can be used by any bosy in order to calculate easily, effectively accurately.

## Calculator Application Features

The main aim of Calculator application is o solve mathematical calculations easily. The features in this application are we can add, substract, divide, multiply, find xor, find minimum number, maximum number, power of numbers, factorial of a num.

| HR02| Relational Operations | Technical | TBI |
| HR03| Permuations | Technical | TBI|
| HR03| Combinations | Techinal | TBI|
| HR04| Factorial | technical|TBI|
| HR05| Bitwise Operations | Technical | TBI|
| HR06| The data should not be lost during failure | Scenario | FUTURE|
| HR07| The undo and redo operations of the operators used| Scenario | FUTURE|
| HR08| Trignometric operations have a good scope | Technical | FUTURE|
| HR08| Answer can be viewed either in decimal or p/q form | Technical | FUTURE|

## Low Level Requirements

|ID | Description | HRID | Status|
|---|-------------|------|-------|
|LR01| For each set of numbers the arthimetic,relational,permuations,combinations,max,min operators are performed and exact output is retrieved.| HR01 | TBI|
|LR02| Each operation has a different methos so that it is easy to understand and implement.| HR02| TBI|
|LR03| Each instruction is given clearly to perform the required operations.| HR03| TBI|
|LR04| The user can perform as many operations as needed untill they require and exit once they are done with the calculations.| HR04|TBI|
|LR05| The data should not be lost if a failure occurs |HR06|FUTURE|
|LR06| The undo and redo operations help lo check them what operations has been performed previuosly.|HR07|FUTURE|
|LR07| Trignometric calculations will be of a big use calculations will be very easy.|HR08|FUTURE|
|LR08| For operations of division and trignometric operations answer should be dispalyed either in decimal or p/q form.|HR08|FUTURE|
